6. Adjust the circle size by clicking and dragging anywhere close to the parameter of the big red circle
   ** Try to get all the colonies/plaques in the big red circle, but as little of anything else in it **
7. To define "Mean colony size": Move the blue circle by clicking and dragging it to a colony of a representative size
8. Adjust the blue circle size the same way you do with the red circle
9. Then click "Analyze" on the left hand panel to see estimated count result


You got it! And yeah, you should just use ImageJ....... >_<
